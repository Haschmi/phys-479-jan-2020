## The SLURMN Job scheduler

An HPC system might have thousands of nodes and thousands of
users. How do we decide who gets what and when? How do we ensure that
a task is run with the resources it needs? This job is handled by a
special piece of software called the scheduler. On an HPC system, the
scheduler manages which jobs run where and when.

The following illustration compares these tasks of a job scheduler to
a waiter in a restaurant. If you can relate to an instance where you
had to wait for a while in a queue to get in to a popular restaurant,
then you may now understand why sometimes your job do not start
instantly as in your laptop.

Although SLURM is not used everywhere, running jobs is quite similar
regardless of what software is being used. The exact syntax might
change, but the concepts remain the same.

## Running a batch job

The most basic use of the scheduler is to run a command
non-interactively. Any command (or series of commands) that you want
to run on the cluster is called a job, and the process of using a
scheduler to run the job is called batch job submission.

In this case, the job we want to run is just a shell script. Let’s create a demo shell script to run as a test.

## A simple test job

Using your favorite text editor, create the following script and run
it. Does it run on the cluster or just our login node?

~~~~ {.output}
#!/bin/bash

echo 'This script is running on:'
hostname
sleep 120
~~~~

To submit this job to the scheduler, we use the sbatch command.

~~~~ {.python}
$ sbatch  example-job.sh
~~~~
~~~~ {.output}
Submitted batch job 4242383
~~~~

And that’s all we need to do to submit a job. Our work is done now the
scheduler takes over and tries to run the job for us. While the job is
waiting to run, it goes into a list of jobs called the queue. To check
on our job’s status, we check the queue using the command squeue -u
yourUsername.

~~~~ {.python}
$ squeue -u hasch
~~~~
~~~~ {.output}
JOBID          PARTITION  NAME            USER     ST TIME       CPUS MIN_MEMORY NODELIST(REASON)
4242383        reserved   example-job.sh  hasch    R  0:23       1    1G         cac026
~~~~

We can see all the details of our job, most importantly that it is in
the “R” or “RUNNING” state. Sometimes our jobs might need to wait in a
queue (“PENDING”) or have an error. The best way to check our job’s
status is with squeue. Of course, running squeue repeatedly to check
on things can be a little tiresome. To see a real-time view of our
jobs, we can use the watch command. watch reruns a given command at
2-second intervals. This is too frequent, and will likely upset your
system administrator. You can change the interval to a more reasonable
value, for example 60 seconds, with the -n 60 parameter. Let’s try
using it to monitor another job.

~~~~ {.python}
$ sbatch  example-job.sh
$ watch -n 60 squeue -u yourUsername
~~~~

You should see an auto-updating display of your job’s status. When it
finishes, it will disappear from the queue. Press Ctrl-C when you want
to stop the watch command.

~~~~ {.output}
Every 60.0s: squeue -u hasch                            Thu Nov 28 11:12:56 2019

JOBID          PARTITION  NAME            USER     ST TIME       CPUS MIN_MEMORY
 NODELIST(REASON)
4242385        reserved   example-job.sh  hasch    R  0:17       1    1G
 cac026
~~~~

## Customising a job

The job we just ran used all of the scheduler’s default options. In a
real-world scenario, that’s probably not what we want. The default
options represent a reasonable minimum. Chances are, we will need more
cores, more memory, more time, among other special considerations. To
get access to these resources we must customize our job script.

Comments in UNIX (denoted by #) are typically ignored. But there are
exceptions. For instance the special #! comment at the beginning of
scripts specifies what program should be used to run it (typically
/bin/bash). Schedulers like also have a special comment used to denote
special scheduler-specific options. Though these comments differ from
scheduler to scheduler, ‘s special comment is #SBATCH. Anything
following the #SBATCH comment is interpreted as an instruction to the
scheduler.

Let’s illustrate this by example. By default, a job’s name is the name
of the script, but the -J option can be used to change the name of a
job.

Submit the following job (sbatch example-job.sh):

~~~~ {.python}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J new_name

echo 'This script is running on:'
hostname
sleep 120
~~~~

~~~~ {.python}
$ squeue -u hasch
~~~~
~~~~ {.output}
JOBID          PARTITION  NAME            USER     ST TIME       CPUS MIN_MEMORY NODELIST(REASON)
4242387        reserved   new_name        hasch    R  0:10       1    1G         cac026
~~~~

We changed the name of our job.

## Setting up email notifications

Jobs on an HPC system might run for days or even weeks. We probably
have better things to do than constantly check on the status of our
job with squeue. Looking at the man page for sbatch, can you set up
our test job to send you an email when it finishes?

## Resource requests

But what about more important changes, such as the number of cores and
memory for our jobs? One thing that is absolutely critical when
working on an HPC system is specifying the resources required to run a
job. This allows the scheduler to find the right time and place to
schedule our job. If you do not specify requirements (such as the
amount of time you need), you will likely be stuck with your site’s
default resources, which is probably not what we want.

The following are several key resource requests:

--nodes= How many nodes does your job need?

--cpus-per-node= How many CPUs does your job need?

--mem=<megabytes>  How much memory on a node does your job need in megabytes? You can also specify gigabytes using by adding a little “g” afterwards (example: --mem=5g)

--time <days-hours:minutes:seconds> How much real-world time (walltime) will your job take to run? The <days> part can be omitted.

Note that just requesting these resources does not make your job run
faster! We’ll talk more about how to make sure that you’re using
resources effectively in a later episode of this lesson.

## Submitting resource requests

Submit a job that will use 1 full node and 5 minutes of walltime.

## Job environment variables

When SLURM runs a job, it sets a number of environment variables for
the job. One of these will let us check our work from the last
problem. The SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK variable is set to the number of CPUs
we requested with -c. Using the SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK variable, modify
your job so that it prints how many CPUs have been allocated.

Resource requests are typically binding. If you exceed them, your job
will be killed. Let’s use walltime as an example. We will request 30
seconds of walltime, and attempt to run a job for two minutes.

~~~~ {.output}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --time=00:00:30

echo 'This script is running on:'
hostname
sleep 120
~~~~

Submit the job and wait for it to finish. Once it is has finished, check the log file.

~~~~ {.python}
$ sbatch  example-job.sh
$ watch -n 60 squeue -u yourUsername
$ cat slurm-38193.out
~~~~

~~~~ {.output}
This job is running on:
gra533

slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 38193 ON gra533 CANCELLED AT 2017-07-02T16:35:48 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
~~~~

Our job was killed for exceeding the amount of resources it
requested. Although this appears harsh, this is actually a
feature. Strict adherence to resource requests allows the scheduler to
find the best possible place for your jobs. Even more importantly, it
ensures that another user cannot use more resources than they’ve been
given. If another user messes up and accidentally attempts to use all
of the cores or memory on a node, SLURM will either restrain their job
to the requested resources or kill the job outright. Other jobs on the
node will be unaffected. This means that one user cannot mess up the
experience of others, the only jobs affected by a mistake in
scheduling will be their own.

## Cancelling a job

Sometimes we’ll make a mistake and need to cancel a job. This can be
done with the scancel command. Let’s submit a job and then cancel it
using its job number (remember to change the walltime so that it runs
long enough for you to cancel it before it is killed!).

~~~~ {.python}
$ sbatch  example-job.sh
$ squeue -u yourUsername
~~~~
~~~~ {.output}
Submitted batch job 38759

JOBID USER         ACCOUNT     NAME           ST REASON   START_TIME TIME TIME_LEFT NODES CPUS
38759 yourUsername yourAccount example-job.sh PD Priority N/A        0:00 1:00      1     1
~~~~

Now cancel the job with it’s job number. Absence of any job info
indicates that the job has been successfully cancelled.

~~~~ {.python}
$ scancel 38759
... Note that it might take a minute for the job to disappear from the queue ...
$ squeue -u yourUsername
~~~~
~~~~ {.output}
JOBID  USER  ACCOUNT  NAME  ST  REASON  START_TIME  TIME  TIME_LEFT  NODES  CPUS
~~~~

## Cancelling multiple jobs

We can also all of our jobs at once using the -u option. This will
delete all jobs for a specific user (in this case us). Note that you
can only delete your own jobs.

Try submitting multiple jobs and then cancelling them all with scancel
-u yourUsername.

## Other types of jobs

Up to this point, we’ve focused on running jobs in batch mode. SLURM
also provides the ability to start an interactive session.

There are very frequently tasks that need to be done
interactively. Creating an entire job script might be overkill, but
the amount of resources required is too much for a login node to
handle. A good example of this might be building a genome index for
alignment with a tool like HISAT2. Fortunately, we can run these types
of tasks as a one-off with srun.

srun runs a single command on the cluster and then exits. Let’s
demonstrate this by running the hostname command with srun. (We can
cancel an srun job with Ctrl-c.)

~~~~ {.python}
$ srun hostname
~~~~
~~~~ {.output}
gra752
~~~~

srun accepts all of the same options as sbatch. However, instead of
specifying these in a script, these options are specified on the
command-line when starting a job. To submit a job that uses 2 CPUs for
instance, we could use the following command:

~~~~ {.python}
$ srun -c 2 echo "This job will use 2 CPUs."
~~~~
~~~~ {.output}
This job will use 2 CPUs.
~~~~

Typically, the resulting shell environment will be the same as that for sbatch.

## Interactive jobs

Sometimes, you will need a lot of resource for interactive
use. Perhaps it’s our first time running an analysis or we are
attempting to debug something that went wrong with a previous
job. Fortunately, SLURM makes it easy to start an interactive job with
srun:

~~~~ {.python}
hasch@caclogin03$ srun --pty bash
~~~~
~~~~ {.output}
hasch@cac026$
~~~~

You should be presented with a bash prompt. Note that the prompt will
likely change to reflect your new location, in this case the compute
node we are logged on. You can also verify this with hostname.

Key Points

* The scheduler handles how compute resources are shared between users.
* Everything you do should be run through the scheduler.
* A job is just a shell script.
* If in doubt, request more resources than you will need.

## Serial and parallel job scripts

Normally, you're using cluster resources to be able to run your work
on many cores or cpu's. If your program is able to utilize multiple
CPU's within a single job submission, it usually does so through one
of two techniques:

* Either by utilizing shared-memory multithreading (for instance
  through so-called Posix threads, or by being compiled with OpenMP
  compiler directives). This works only within a single cluster node.
* Or by being written specifically for a cluster, very often using
  MPI, the Message Passing Interface. We will hear a lot more about
  that.

Of course, there is an alternative method of making use of the
availability of many cores: you can run a lot of serial jobs at the
same time. This may not be the intended use of a cluster that is built
to run really big jobs, but in a way it's the most efficient one
because it's guaranteed to be "parallel". Let's start with that. A
typical serial job looks something like this:

~~~~ {.python}
#SBATCH --job-name=serial_test 
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL 
#SBATCH --mail-user=joe.user@email.ca 
#SBATCH --output=STD.out 
#SBATCH --error=STD.err 
#SBATCH --time=30:00 
#SBATCH --mem=1G 
./my_program 
~~~~

Note the time and memory specification. They should be chosen bigger
than necessary, but not so big as to prevent proper
scheduling. Everything else is pretty obvious. If you need to run 1000
of these that will keep the cluster busy. Although it may require to
write a script to submit them automatically. In that case, test it out
first with a few and only if you are certain it works as expected, run
the script.

An alternative is to use array jobs. We'll discuss them later.

If your job is parallel of the multi-threaded type, you need to specify some extra parameters:

~~~~ {.python}
#SBATCH --job-name=MPI_test 
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL 
#SBATCH --mail-user=joe.user@email.ca 
#SBATCH --output=STD.out 
#SBATCH --error=STD.err 
#SBATCH --nodes=1 
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
#SBATCH --time=30:00 
#SBATCH --mem=1G 
OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK ./mt_program.exe
~~~~

The --nodes parameter must be set to 1 as multithreaded programs don't
run "across nodes". The number of tasks is also kept at one because
multiple threads are dynamically created and the system is only
starting one main program. In the above example the program has been
multi-threaded using OpenMP directives, and we are setting the number
of threads through an environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS. Other
methods use different approaches to pass this information to the
program, but the principle is the same. The scheduler reserves an
number of CPU's equal to the number of threads we start (that's the
--cpus-per-task parameter) and the information gets passed on through
SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK.

Finally, if your program is full-blown parallel (usually using MPI),
then you would be using something like this:

~~~~ {.python}
#SBATCH --job-name=MPI_test 
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL 
#SBATCH --mail-user=joe.user@email.ca 
#SBATCH --output=STD.out 
#SBATCH --error=STD.err 
#SBATCH --nodes=1 
#SBATCH --ntasks=8 
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1 
#SBATCH --time=30:00 
#SBATCH --mem=1G 
mpirun -np $SLURM_NTASKS ./mpi_program 
~~~~

In this case, the number of nodes may also be larger than 1 although
in this example, it's set to one. If you need a number of CPU's that
is smaller than the number available on the cluster within a single
node, and you got no memory issues, it's good to use only one because
communication inside of a node is faster thhan between nodes. But if
you need more, you can increase it. You can set the number of
processes you awat to run by setting --ntasks. The --cpus-per-task
parameter is kept at one because for most programs each CPU runs a
single task. There are programs that make use of both multi-threading
and MPI, but let's ignore that for now. The last line starts an MPI
program with a given number of processes (tasks). We get details about
that later.

## Array jobs

If you are running many jobs, managing all the independent submissions to the scheduler can become difficult and error prone.

~~~~ {.python}
#SBATCH --job-name=array_test 
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL 
#SBATCH --mail-user=joe.user@email.ca 
#SBATCH --output=STD.out 
#SBATCH --error=STD.err 
#SBATCH --time=30:00 
#SBATCH --mem=1G 
#SBATCH --array=0-100
./my_program < input.$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID
~~~~

With the --array parameter, you are specifying a range of values that
is taken by an internal variable SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID. In this case we
are telling SLURM to run 101 jobs with that variable ranging from 0 to
100 (inclusive). In the last line of the script, we are then
instructing for each job to run the same program but with different
input files. This certainly beats submitting 101 jobs manually.
