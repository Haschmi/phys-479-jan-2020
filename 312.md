## Finite differences in more than 1D

The extension of the simple approximation of the 1D heat equation
to more than 1 dimension is rather straight-forward. Assuming that we have the same heat conductivity in both directions, and still ignoring any source terms we have:

du/dt = k * (d2u/dx^2 + d2u/dz^2)

which can be discretized the same way as in one direction, just yielding a somewhat longer expresssion

[u(n+1,i,j) - u(n,i,j)]/dt =
k * {[u(n,i,j+1)-2*u(n,i,j)+u(n,i,j-1)]/(dx)^2} +
     [u(n,i+1,j)-2*u(n,i,j)+u(n,i-1,j)]/(dz)^2}

This assumes an isotropic Cartesian grid, and since it's best to use
the same spacing in both direction, we may as well set dx=dz=d. The
indices j and i are counting the gridpoints in x and z direction,
respectively. Everything else is like in 1D. In the case of three
dimensions we'd have three tterms and indices, but the basic form is
the same.
