## What is an HPC system?

The words “cloud”, “cluster”, and “high-performance computing” are
used a lot in different contexts and with varying degrees of
correctness. So what do they mean exactly? And more importantly, how
do we use them for our work?

The cloud is a generic term commonly used to refer to remote computing
resources of any kind that is, any computers that you use but are not
right in front of you. Cloud can refer to machines serving websites,
providing shared storage, providing webservices (such as e-mail or
social media platforms), as well as more traditional “compute”
resources. An HPC system on the other hand, is a term used to describe
a network of computers. The computers in a cluster typically share a
common purpose, and are used to accomplish tasks that might otherwise
be too big for any one computer.

## Login

Let's log in to the cluster: Frontenac at Queen's

~~~~ {.python}
$ ssh yourUsername@login.cac.queensu.ca
~~~~
~~~~ {.output}

===============================================================================
Welcome to the CAC cluster Frontenac!

For more info on using this system, please see our wiki at:
https://cac.queensu.ca/wiki/index.php/Frontenac

If you run into any issues, please email us at cac.help@queensu.ca.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that this node is for workup, testing, and job submission only.
All production jobs must be submitted to the Frontenac cluster through
the SLURM scheduler (https://cac.queensu.ca/wiki/index.php/SLURM).
User jobs will be terminated without notice.

Remember to replace yourUsername with the username supplied by the instructor. You will be asked for your password. But watch out, the characters you type are not displayed on the screen.

You are logging in using a program known as the secure shell or ssh. This establishes a temporary encrypted connection between your laptop and the "login node: of the Frontenac compute cluster. The word before the @ symbol, e.g. yourUsername here, is the user account name that Lola has access permissions for on the cluster.

## Secure Shell (ssh)

ssh stands for "secure shell". It is a protocoll that uses a decoded data stream. The "ssh" utility is used for login. Others are used for data transfer : "sftp" and "scp" (for "secure file transfer protocol" and "secure copy".

On Linux and/or macOS, the ssh command line utility is almost always pre-installed. Open a terminal and type ssh --help to check if that is the case.

For Windows systems we recommend MobaXterm. Download it, install it and open the GUI. The GUI asks for your user name and the destination address or IP of the computer you want to connect to. Once provided, you will be queried for your password.

## Basic orientation

Very often, users are tempted to think of a high-performance
computing installation as one large machine. Sometimes,
people will assume that the computer they’ve logged onto is the entire
computing cluster. So what’s really happening? What computer have we
logged on to? The name of the current computer we are logged onto can
be checked with the hostname command. (You may also notice that the
current hostname is also part of our prompt!)

~~~~ {.python}
$ hostname
