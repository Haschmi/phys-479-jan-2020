## Research Computing in Canada

We give a short overview on Canadian academic research computing in a slide deck.
This inculdes:

* Compute Canada (national organization)
* Compute Ontario (provincial organization)
* Individual "Consortia" and Compute Centres
* National platform systems
* The Centre for Advanced Computing
* The Frontenac Compute Cluster

## What is an HPC system?

The words “cloud”, “cluster”, and “high-performance computing” are
used a lot in different contexts and with varying degrees of
correctness. So what do they mean exactly? And more importantly, how
do we use them for our work?

The cloud is a generic term commonly used to refer to remote computing
resources of any kind that is, any computers that you use but are not
right in front of you. Cloud can refer to machines serving websites,
providing shared storage, providing webservices (such as e-mail or
social media platforms), as well as more traditional “compute”
resources. An HPC system on the other hand, is a term used to describe
a network of computers. The computers in a cluster typically share a
common purpose, and are used to accomplish tasks that might otherwise
be too big for any one computer.

## Login

Let's log in to the cluster: Frontenac at Queen's

~~~~ {.python}
$ ssh yourUsername@login.cac.queensu.ca
~~~~
~~~~ {.output}
Last login: Thu Nov 28 08:26:42 2019 from s2-n59.gen.queensu.ca

===============================================================================
Welcome to the CAC cluster Frontenac!

For more info on using this system, please see our wiki at:
https://cac.queensu.ca/wiki/index.php/Frontenac

If you run into any issues, please email us at cac.help@queensu.ca.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that this node is for workup, testing, and job submission only.
All production jobs must be submitted to the Frontenac cluster through
the SLURM scheduler (https://cac.queensu.ca/wiki/index.php/SLURM).
User jobs will be terminated without notice.

===============================================================================
~~~~

Remember to replace yourUsername with the username supplied by the
instructor. You will be asked for your password. But watch out, the
characters you type are not displayed on the screen.

You are logging in using a program known as the secure shell or
ssh. This establishes a temporary encrypted connection between your
laptop and the "login node: of the Frontenac compute cluster. The word
before the @ symbol, e.g. yourUsername here, is the user account name
that Lola has access permissions for on the cluster.

## Secure Shell (ssh)

ssh stands for "secure shell". It is a protocoll that uses a decoded
data stream. The "ssh" utility is used for login. Others are used for
data transfer : "sftp" and "scp" (for "secure file transfer protocol"
and "secure copy".

On Linux and/or macOS, the ssh command line utility is almost always
pre-installed. Open a terminal and type ssh --help to check if that is
the case.

For Windows systems we recommend MobaXterm. Download it, install it
and open the GUI. The GUI asks for your user name and the destination
address or IP of the computer you want to connect to. Once provided,
you will be queried for your password.

## Basic orientation

Very often, users are tempted to think of a high-performance
computing installation as one large machine. Sometimes,
people will assume that the computer they’ve logged onto is the entire
computing cluster. So what’s really happening? What computer have we
logged on to? The name of the current computer we are logged onto can
be checked with the hostname command. (You may also notice that the
current hostname is also part of our prompt!)

~~~~ {.python}
$ hostname
caclogin03
~~~~

## Nodes

Individual computers that compose a cluster are typically called nodes
(although you will also hear people call them servers, computers and
machines). On a cluster, there are different types of nodes for
different types of tasks. The node where you are right now is called
the head node, login node or submit node. A login node serves as an
access point to the cluster. As a gateway, it is well suited for
uploading and downloading files, setting up software, and running
quick tests. It should never be used for doing actual work.

The real work on a cluster gets done by the worker (or compute)
nodes. Worker nodes come in many shapes and sizes, but generally are
dedicated to long or hard tasks that require a lot of computational
resources.

All interaction with the worker nodes is handled by a specialized
piece of software called a scheduler (the scheduler used in this
lesson is called SLURM). We’ll learn more about how to use the
scheduler to submit jobs next, but for now, it can also tell us more
information about the worker nodes.

For example, we can view all of the worker nodes with the sinfo command.

~~~~ {.python}
$ sinfo

There are also specialized machines used for managing disk storage,
user authentication, and other infrastructure-related tasks. Although
we do not typically logon to or interact with these machines directly,
they enable a number of key features like ensuring our user account
and files are available throughout the HPC system.

## What is inside a node ?

All of a HPC system’s nodes have the same components as your own
laptop or desktop: CPUs (sometimes also called processors or cores),
memory (or RAM), and disk space. CPUs are a computer’s tool for
actually running programs and calculations. Information about a
current task is stored in the computer’s memory. Disk refers to all
storage that can be accessed like a file system. This is generally
storage that can hold data permanently, i.e. data is still there even
if the computer has been restarted.

We can get information about the headnode using system query
commands. Here are a few examples. To determine the available number
of processors, for instance:

~~~~ {.python}
$ nproc --all
24
~~~~
~~~~ {.output}
24
~~~~

To show details about the CPU's on the system:

~~~~ {.python}
$ lscpu
~~~~
~~~~ {.output}

If you want to know how much memory you have available, you can use

~~~~ {.python}
$ free -m
~~~~
~~~~ {.output}
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:         161010       97483       60011         402        3514       62001
Swap:          8191        7135        1056
~~~~

For even greater detail about memory you can use the command

~~~~ {.python}
$ cat /proc/meminfo
~~~~ 

## What about the other nodes ?

Of course the above commands are issued at the commandline, and apply
to the login node on which you are currently working. To get
information about the cluster nodes you need to ask the scheduler. The
sinfo command has many options that allow you to get details about a
specific node. A basic quick look at cac108 can be had this way:

~~~~ {.python}
$ sinfo -n cac108 -o "%n %c %m"
~~~~ 
~~~~ {.output}
HOSTNAMES CPUS MEMORY
cac108 32 180000
~~~~

So this particular node (cac108) has 32 CPU's and 180 GB of memory (base unit is Megabyte).

## Navigating around

Here are a few basic Unix command to help us navigate the system. Note
that sometimes individual systems deviate in the details. To work on
an HPC system it's pretty much a "must" to know some
Unix/Linux/bash. WSe suggest to get a cheat sheet from the web and
have is beside you.

Right now, all we see is something that looks like this (probably the
prompt is more elaborate, but let's ignore that for now):

~~~ {.bash}
$
~~~

The dollar sign is a **prompt**, which shows us that the shell is waiting for input;
your shell may use a different character as a prompt and may add information before
the prompt. When typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources,
do not type the prompt, only the commands that follow it.

Type the command `whoami`, then press the Enter key (sometimes marked
Return) to send the command to the shell. The command's output is the
ID of the current user, i.e., it shows us who the shell thinks we are:

~~~ {.bash}
$ whoami
~~~
~~~ {.output}
hasch
~~~

More specifically, when we type `whoami` the shell:

1.  finds a program called `whoami`,
2.  runs that program,
3.  displays that program's output, then
4.  displays a new prompt to tell us that it's ready for more commands.

Next, let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd`
(which stands for "print working directory"). At any moment, our
**current working directory** (where we are) is the directory that the
computer assumes we want to run commands in unless we explicitly
specify something else.  Here, the computer's response is
`/Users/jeff`, which is Jeff's **home directory**:

~~~ {.bash}
$ pwd
~~~
~~~ {.output}
/global/home/hasch
~~~

> ## Home directory 

>The home directory path will look different on different operating
>systems.  On Linux it will look like `/global/home/hasch`, and on Windows it
>will be similar to `C:\Documents and Settings\hasch`.  Note that it
>may look slightly different for different versions of Windows.

So, we know where we are. How do we look and see what's in our current directory?
```{.bash}
ls
```

`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current
directory in alphabetical order, arranged neatly into columns.

If nothing shows up, it means that nothing's there. Let's make a
directory for us to play with.

`mkdir <new directory name>` makes a new directory with that name in
your current location. Notice that this command required two pieces of
input: the actual name of the command (`mkdir`) and an argument that
specifies the name of the directory you wish to create.

```{.bash}
mkdir Documents
```

Let's us `ls` again. What do we see?

Our folder is there. What if we wanted to go inside it and do stuff there?

We will use the `cd` (change directory) command to move around. Let's
`cd` into our new Documents folder.

```{.bash}
cd Documents
pwd
```
```{.output}
~/Documents
```

Now that we know how to use `cd`, we can go anywhere. That's a lot of
responsibility. What happens if we get "lost" and want to get back to
where we started?

To go back to your home directory, the following two commands will work:

```{.bash}
cd /home/yourUserName
cd ~
```

What is the `~` character? When using the shell, `~` is a shortcut
that represents `/home/yourUserName`.

A quick note on the structure of a UNIX
(Linux/Mac/Android/Solaris/etc) filesystem. Directories and absolute
paths (i.e. exact position in the system) are always prefixed with a
`/`. `/` is the "root" or base directory.

Let's go there now, look around, and then return to our home directory.
```{.bash}
cd /
ls
cd ~
```

Our "home" directory is the one where we generally want to keep all of
our files. Other folders on a UNIX OS contain system files, and get
modified and changed as you install new software or upgrade your OS.

> ## Using the Centre for Advanced Computing filesystem 

> On Centre for Advanced Computing systems, you have a number of
> places where you can store your files. These differ in both the
> amount of space allocated and whether or not they are backed up.
> File storage locations:  
> **/home** (your home directory) - 500 GB, backed up  
> **/global/project** - variable (priced), backed up  
> **/global/scratch/** - 5 TB, NOT backed up, purged regularly

There are several other useful shortcuts you should be aware of.  

+ `.` represents your current directory   

+ `..` represents the "parent" directory of your current location

+ While typing nearly *anything*, you can have bash try to autocomplete what you are typing by pressing the `tab` key.  


Let's try these out now:
```{.bash}
cd ./Documents
pwd

cd ..
pwd
```

Many commands also have multiple behaviors that you can invoke with
command line 'flags.' What is a flag? It's generally just your command
followed by a '-' and the name of the flag (sometimes it's '--'
followed by the name of the flag. You follow the flag(s) with any
additional arguments you might need.

We're going to demonstrate a couple of these "flags" using `ls`.

Show hidden files with `-a`. Hidden files are files that begin with
`.`, these files will not appear otherwise, but that doesn't mean they
aren't there!
```{.bash}
ls -a
```

Show files, their size in bytes, date last modified, permissions, and
other things with `-l`.
```{.bash}
ls -l
```

This is a lot of information to take in at once, but we will explain
this later! `ls -l` is *extremely* useful, and tells you almost
everything you need to know about your files without actually looking
at them.


We can also use multiple flags at the same time!
```{.bash}
ls -l -a
```

Flags generally precede any arguments passed to a UNIX command. `ls`
actually takes an extra argument that specifies a directory to look
into.

When you use flags and arguments together, they syntax (how it's
supposed to be typed) generally looks something like this:
```{.bash}
command <flags/options> <arguments>
```

So using `ls -l` on a different directory than the one we're in would look something like:
```{.bash}
ls -l ~/Documents
```

How did I know about the `-l` and `-a` options? Is there a manual we
can look at for help when we need help?

There is, in fact, a very helpful manual for most UNIX commands: `man`
(if you've ever heard of a "man page" for something, this is what it
is).
```{.bash}
man ls
```

You can scroll through this manual using the arrow keys. To close the
manual, press the `q` to exit.
